#  Fela Kuti Tribute Page 
I chose to make my tribute Page about Fela Kuti because he is a legend, forever imprinted in the history of Nigeria and the rest of the world. 

His lyrics are infused with both political and social critique, which during the time of Nigeria's military dictatorship was revolutionary.
## What I have learnt so far 
I learnt a lot about using differnet applications like git and learning more about HTML and CSS. 

Furthermore, I learnt a lot about how I can best learn all of this new infromation, I have found watching tutorials has aided in better retention.

Upon reflection, I have been able to acknowledge the diffciluty in acquiring these new skills, but I also have noticed my own motivation and inspiration to keep coming back even if it maybe difficult.
